- Lots (Not very well logged :-| )

Changes Since 1.0
-----------------
This release will be the one exhibited at GD2001 in Vienna 23-26th September.
The are many new features and bug fixes and probably some new bugs as well 
(please report them!).

 - UML node and edge objects added
 - Planar force added
 - Box and Planar Clusters added
 - nodes can now be fixed in space and dragged around
 - certain types of clusters such as planar clusters are able to spin and rotate
 - Less visibly a lot of code has changed in Cluster class meaning that deeply nested graphs should be a bit more reliable.
