<h2>Adding Nodes and Edges</h2>
      When you start Wilma you will see the following window:<br>
  <br>
  <img src="wilmastart.png" alt="Wilma on start up" width="300" height="300">
  <br>
  <br>
        You start with an empty canvas (the black area). &nbsp;To add your
 first  node click the "add node" button... (highlighted above).<br>
  <br>
     A single node will appear in the centre of the canvas:<br>
  <img src="firstnode.png" alt="First node appears..." width="300" height="300">
  <br>
  <br>
     Note that the message panel provides hints for what to do in any given 
 situation.<br>
  <br>
     Now if you right click on the new node a menu will appear:<br>
  <img src="nodemenu.png" alt="Node right click menu..." width="300" height="300">
  <br>
  <br>
     If you select the first option from this menu: "Add Node..." another 
node   will appear attached to the first node by an edge. &nbsp;Repeat this 
to create  a three connected nodes:<br>
  <br>
  <img src="threenodes.png" alt="Three nodes..." width="300" height="300">
  <br>
  <br>
     Note that the graph may not be in quite the same orientation as shown
 above.  &nbsp;You can rotate, zoom or translate the scene by clicking anywhere
 on  the canvas not occupied by a node or an edge and dragging. &nbsp; Dragging 
  with the left mouse button rotates, middle button zooms and the right button 
  translates. &nbsp;The bottom panel in wilma shows some pictures to remind 
  you how to use the mouse to change the orientation.<br>
  <br>
     Note that if you don't have a middle button holding down the "Alt" key 
 at  the same time as the left mouse button does the same thing.<br>
  <br>
     Now right click on the leftmost node and this time choose the second 
option:   "Add Edge...". &nbsp;You will see that the node you chose to add 
an edge  to has turned yellow, indicating that it's waiting for you to select 
another   node for the other end of the edge. &nbsp;You could cancel the operation
 at this stage by left clicking on the yellow node. &nbsp;But don't do that
 ;-)... left click on the &nbsp;rightmost node. &nbsp;A new edge will appear
 forming a triangle.<br>
  <br>
     Note that you can add disconnected nodes using the "Add Node" button 
in  the toolbar (the first button we used). &nbsp;Try that now. &nbsp;You 
can  also create new edges by clicking on the "Add Edge" button... you will 
then  be required to select two nodes and then press the "OK" button that 
appears  in the message panel. &nbsp;Create an edge between the new disconnected
 node  you just created and one of the nodes in the triangle:<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
    Note that if you repeat this action, to create two edges between the
same   two nodes, both edges will be visible:<br>
  <br>
  <img src="doubleedge.png" alt="Double edge..." width="310" height="302">
  <br>
  <br>
Note that there are different types of nodes and edges available... if you
click on the little arrows beside the "Add Node" button and the "Add Edge"
button you will be offered a selection... when you chose a new type of node
or edge that new type will become the default type that is created. &nbsp;The
pictures on the respective buttons will change to remind you which one is
currently the default:<br>

<br>
  <br>
In the picture above different node and edge types have been used. &nbsp;You
can also change the type for an edge by right clicking on the edge:<br>
