<h2>Fixing nodes in position and moving them around</h2>
There are two more options available when you right click on a node which
we need to discuss:<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Drag: Allows you to move the node to a new position using the mouse</li>
  <li>Fixed Position: When this option is checked the node is no longer affected
by the forces affecting other nodes.</li>
</ul>
When you fix a node's position a small blue "pin" appears on the sphere's
surface:<br>

<br>
<br>
When you select the drag option you can move the node to a new position by
right clicking on the desired location with the mouse. &nbsp;You can also
hold the right button down and drag the node around. &nbsp;When you release
the mouse button, if the node is not fixed, it will spring back into position.
&nbsp;If it is fixed it will stay where you told it to go.<br>
<br>
When you move a node in this way it moves to a position at the same depth
from the view plane, but directly underneath the mouse pointer. &nbsp;You
can still rotate the whole scene by dragging with the left mouse button so
if you want to move the node to a new depth then first rotate the graph so
that you get a side on view, and the drag it to the new depth.<br>
<br>
When you're finished dragging the node, hit the "Done" button.<br>

Be careful, this is a lot of fun, and it's easy to get carried away:<br>
