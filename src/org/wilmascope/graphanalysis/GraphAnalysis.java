/**
 * A graph analysis plug-in must extend the
 * org.wilmascope.graphanalysis.GraphAnalysis class, implementing the getName
 * and analyse methods. As with GraphModifier, getName simply returns a
 * descriptive string. The analyse method takes no argument. Rather, you must
 * use getCluster() to operate on the cluster in the analyse method.
 * 
 * There is no need for a getControls method in GraphAnalysis plug-ins. By
 * default an instance of AnalysisPanel is created by this super class.
 * AnalysisPanel allows a user to choose visual mappings for the results of the
 * analysis, and appears in the Graph Analysis window.
