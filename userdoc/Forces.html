<h2>Forces</h2>
It is possible to adjust the forces affecting the layout of the graph by
clicking on the "Adjust Forces" button in the toolbar.<br>

<br>
When you select this button the following controls will appear in a new window:<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The check box on the left allows you to disable a force completely while
the slider on the right allows you to adjust the strength of the force.<br>
<br>
The forces are as follows:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Spring: the "Springiness" of the edges</li>
  <li>Repulsion: the repulsive force between nodes</li>
  <li>Origin: a force drawing all nodes towards the origin, or centre of
the graph. &nbsp;This helps to keep disconnected graph elements from flying
off into space never to be seen again.</li>
  <li>Directed Field: a "Magnetic Force Field" which causes directed edges
to be alligned with the field. &nbsp;This is useful when you have a tree
like graph... the root of the tree will float to the top and the leaves will
hang down.</li>
  <li>Planar: A force which squashes everything into a plane.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
 Each cluster has its own force model. &nbsp;You can adjust the forces inside
a cluster by right clicking on the cluster and choosing the "Adjust Forces"
option. &nbsp;A window with controls similar to those above will appear.<br>
<br>
Note that inside a cluster the Origin force attracts nodes to the center
of the cluster, giving the cluster a more "Cohesive" look.<br>
