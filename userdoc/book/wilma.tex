As we stated in Section~\ref{motivation}, a major design goal for Wilma
was to provide a platform within which algorithmic experimentation could be
conducted elegantly and efficiently.

\paragraph{}

Force-directed layout algorithms are of course the method of choice for a
wide range of graph visualisation problems.  One variantion on these
algorithms, advocated by Fruchtermann \&
Kawai~\cite{fruchtermann90force-directed}, and Davidson {\em et.
al.}~\cite{davidson01noise}, attempts to avoid calculation of repulsion force
vectors, which is $O(n^2)$ in the number of verticies.  Instead, it is
possible to approximate scalar energy potential values, caching this
information at grid points across space.

\paragraph{}

Iterated updates to the potential well then cost only $O(|V|)$ time per
iteration.  On the downside, the cache array itself takes $O(v \centerdot d)$
memory, where $v$ is the spatial volume of the embedded graph and $d$ is the
density of stored potential information.
