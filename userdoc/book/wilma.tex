\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\subsection{Witty Survey Subsection}
{\em survey previous stuff.}

\subsection{The Motivation for WilmaScope}
\label{motivation}

Despite, or perhaps because of, the extensive research literature on graph
drawing techniques, there is a lack of state-of-the-art, general-purpose
visualisation systems, particularly for application to 3-dimensional
embeddings.

Graph drawing problems are, of course, existent within an enormous range of
fields; a key motivation for creating a general purpose 3D visualisation
system is to provide easy-to-use components which can be employed by future
software across these application domains.

Within the graph drawing community itself, a system may also aspire to 
streamline, elucidate and beautify the work of algorithm design, comparison
and optimisation.  Achieving these benefits requires software which is
flexible, interactive and easily extensible.

In order to provide these benefits as widely as possible, and to guarantee
an enthusiastic culture of user participation, a serious graph visualisation
system should also be {\em Free Software}\cite{stallman92why}.

In this chapter, we describe WilmaScope (or ``Wilma'', for short), a
sophisticated graph visualisation infrastructure, which attempts to meet
these goals.  In Section~\ref{sec:design}, we describe the Wilma
architecture, modular subsystems, and facilities for control by human users
and other software.  Section~\ref{sec:results} demonstrates Wilma in
action, with examples of graphical results, domain specific applications and
feedback from users.  Finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} reviews Wilma's
contribution and identifies directions for future development.

\section{Design}\label{sec:design}
\subsection{High Level Architecture}
Conceived as a research project with open ended goals, Wilma was
designed to be as flexible and extensible as possible.  The intention
was to allow different components, such as new visual representations
for graph elements, interfaces (either graphical user interfaces or
remote programming interfaces) and different 
layout algorithm implementations to be added or removed easily.
Therefore the design needed to decouple these components as much as
possible so that altering one component would have minimal impact on
the other components.

To achieve this we began by exploring the well known {\em
Model-View-Controller} architecture (MVC) \cite{gamma94design}.
Briefly, the 3 primary components of the MVC architecture are as
follows: 

\begin{description}
\item[Model] the core
of the application, the data and algorithms that automatically modify
the data. 
\item[View] a user interface which displays information
about the model to the user. 
\item[Controller] a separate user
interface that provides methods for the user to manipulate the
application, ie to control the Model.  
\end{description}

Each component's reference to
the other components is via a carefully defined interface which should
not require change when one of the components is modified in some way.  The
standard data flow diagram for the MVC architecture is shown in Figure
\ref{fig-mvc}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \subfigure[MVC Architecture]{

    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/mvc.eps}}
  \subfigure[Wilma Architecture]{
    \label{fig-wilmamvc}
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/wilmamvc.eps}}
  \caption{The classic MVC framework and Wilma's utilisation of MVC.}
\end{figure}

In our system the Model component is further broken down into two sub-components:
\begin{description}
\item[Graph] a data structure capable of representing the structure
and state of the graph including its arrangement in space.
\item[Layout Engine] an abstraction of the basic methods required for
an implementation of any layout algorithm that will change the graph's
arrangement in space.
\end{description}

A further requirement for our system is that the graph data model,
the layout engine and the visual representation of the graph elements should be controllable from multiple different sources, primarily:
\begin{description}
\item[Graphical User Interface] a user can interactively construct or edit the graph structure.  Also the user can adjust the layout engine parameters and change the visual representation of the graph elements.
\item[File Handler] a previously constructed graph may be loaded from a file.
\item[API Hooks] supports remote control from a program running in another process or possibly on
another machine. 
\end{description}
The Controller component was therefore also broken
down into several sub-components.  A ``bridge'' layer provides a common
programmatic interface to the Model.  The methods provided by this
bridge layer can then be called by either the GUI interface component,
a component providing a CORBA interface for remote access or a component which
can load and save files to an XML format.

Figure \ref{fig-wilmamvc} depicts this expanded MVC architecture for graph
visualisation. 

\subsection{An Object-Oriented Graph Model}
In designing the Graph Model, ie, the data structures for storing the
graph and the methods for manipulating them, some common
elements were identified.  From the definitions given in Chapter 
\ref{chap-intro}: a graph consists fundamentally
of nodes and edges.  These are the basic graph elements.  A clustered
graph has nodes which may themselves be graphs, or clusters.

This description of a graph is modelled in a class hierarchy by
defining an abstract class {\em GraphElement} which is implemented by
both the {\em Node} and {\em Edge} classes.  A {Cluster} will inherit
all the properties of the {\em Node} class and also contains an
aggregation of {\em Nodes} and {\em Edges}.  A {Cluster} also contains
a reference to an abstract definition of a {\em LayoutEngine} which
provides a common interface to an implementation of a layout algorithm
for arranging the graph in 2 or 3 dimensional space.  Since the
details of the algorithm are kept separate it is easy to mix and match
different layout styles to different graphs or even clusters within
the one graph.  A similar class hierarchy was developed independently
by Marshall et.  al\cite{marshall00object} around the same time.
Figure \ref{fig-wilmaclasses} shows a UML diagram depicting this
graph class hierarchy, and also shows how this relates to a force
directed {\em LayoutEngine} implementation, discussed further in
Section \ref{sec:forcedirectedlayout}.  In Figure
\ref{fig-wilmaclasses3d} we show a 3D
interpretation of this UML diagram rendered by Wilma in an application
of the system described further in \ref{sec:3duml}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Platform}

WilmaScope has been implemented in Java, using the Java3D graphics library.
Java provides a good tradeoff between high level language constructs,
portability and performance.  Java3D provides access to 3D graphics accelerator hardware through
a high-level Java API and useful features such as a scene graph
structure and methods for coupling animation into the render cycle.

\subsection{Layout Algorithms}
\subsubsection{Force Directed} \label{sec:forcedirectedlayout}
The first layout algorithm implemented in Wilma was Force Directed
layout whose basic principles are described in Chapter
\ref{chap-intro}.  There were several factors that led us to
implement this algorithm first, notably:
\begin{itemize}
\item it is relatively easy to obtain good results for most types of
graphs by application of the basic attractive spring force and
repulsive inter-node force.
\item it is easy to animate the layout process in a dynamic
graph visualization to preserve a user's ``mental map''\cite{Misue:VLC95}
between changes in the graph structure.  We can animate simply by
redrawing the graph between each iteration of the algorithm.
\item since the algorithm is iterative and does not require any
special pre or post-processing it is easy to use in a dynamic graph
editor, where the graph structure may be changed by the user even
before the layout has stabilised.
\item different layout
aesthetics can be enhanced by adding extra forces, such as the Sugiyama and Misue\cite{Sugiyama:VLC95}
directed field force for aligning directed edges to emphasise flow.
\item the force directed approach can be easily extended to support
clustered graphs \cite{Huang:GD98}
\item it works just as well in 3-dimensions as in 2.
\end{itemize}
The wilma implementation of the force directed algorithm attempts to make the most
of all of these advantages.  Firstly it offers a user interface which
allows the user to control all the parameters of the layout algorithm
even while the layout is still in progress.  The user can control the
number of iterations of the algorithm that are executed between frames
of animation so that they can choose to run the algorithm to
convergence as fast as possible or to watch the layout unfold, and if
necessary tweak the controls to adjust the layout or to help it
converge.

Different forces, such as the directed field force or
a gravitational force which keeps the graph centred, may be added or removed
at any time to achieve different aesthetic effects.  Figure
\ref{fig-wilmaclasses} gives the UML class diagram for the force
directed layout engine.  Since each of the different forces implements
a common interface new forces can be added or removed at any time.

Finally the force directed layout engine fits well into Wilma's object
oriented clustered graph model.  As mentioned previously each cluster
has its own layout engine but when the force directed engine is used,
edges connecting nodes in different clusters exert a force on
the nodes inside these clusters.  The nodes inside a cluster are
attracted to the centroid of the cluster by a ``gravitational force''.
The gravitational force then balances the inter-cluster forces.  This
achieves a net result similar to the ``dummy node'' approach of Huang
and Eades\cite{Huang:GD98} however repulsive forces do not need to be
calculated between nodes inside different clusters.

\subsubsection{Fast Simulated Annealing}

As we stated in Section~\ref{motivation}, a major design goal for Wilma
was to provide a platform within which algorithmic experimentation could be
conducted elegantly and efficiently.

Force-directed layout algorithms are of course the method of choice for a
wide range of graph visualisation problems.  One variation on these
algorithms, advocated by Fruchtermann \&
Rheingold~\cite{fruchtermann90force-directed} and Davidson {\em et.
al.}~\cite{davidson01noise}, attempts to avoid calculation of repulsion force
vectors, which is $O(n^2)$ in the number of vertices:  

\begin{equation}
\vec{R}_i \equiv \sum_{j \in G, j \neq i} \vec{r}_{i,j}
\end{equation}

\noindent Where $\vec{r}_{i,j} = \vec{r}_i - \vec{r}_j$ is the displacement
of node $i$ relative to $j$.

To avoid this expense, it is possible to approximate scalar energy potential
values, caching this information at grid points throughout space.  Iterated
updates to the potential well then cost only $O(|V|)$ time per iteration.  On
the downside, the cache array itself takes $O(v \centerdot d)$ memory, where
$v$ is the $n$-dimensional volume (or area) of the embedded graph and $d$ is
the density of stored potential data points.

Cowling~\cite{cowling02fast} has implemented a fast layout engine for
WilmaScope which employs simulated annealing with potential energy caching
to achieve linear-time graph embeddings.  Cowling was able to demonstrate
that the algorithms of \cite{davidson01noise} do appear to achieve linear
time results, but that when the grid size $v \centerdot d$ must be adjusted to
prevent folding in large graphs, space and time complexity are
no longer linear.  Figure \ref{fig-fastlayout} shows before and after
screenshots of the algorithm's effects.

Cowling's work serves to demonstrate the utility of Wilma as an empirical
platform; with the WilmaScope rendering and navigation system, and the
availability of convenient data structures for input and dataset management,
algorithmic experiments can be performed at optimal speeds.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \subfigure[After only a few iterations.]{

    \label{fig-fastlayout2}
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/fastlayout2.eps}}
  \caption{These screenshots demonstrate the effects of the simulated
  annealing algorithm with potential caching.  Note that the colour of
  the nodes indicates the force potential at that location.}
  \label{fig-fastlayout}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Multiscale Force Directed}

Although the fast simulated annealing approach described above did not prove
perfect as a universal replacement for iterated, force-directed layout, there
are other algorithms in the literature which might be brought to bear.

We have implemented one of these - the ``Multilevel Force-Directed'' approach
of Walshaw~\cite{walshaw00multilevel}.  The primary insight of this
multi-scaled approach is that the effects of repulsion forces at different
ranges are equivalently 

\subsubsection{DOT: heirarchical layout}
DOT is a program included in the Graphviz
(\url{http://www.graphviz.org}) open source graph visualisation
toolkit from AT\&T.  It produces effective 2-dimensional layered graph
layouts using a Sugiyama\cite{Sugiyama81methods} style algorithm.
The Wilma DOT layout engine runs dot in a sub-process, pipes in the graph
data converted into DOT file format and parses the DOT output to
obtain the new layout.
DOT also features aesthetically pleasing spline edges which Wilma
is able to render as curved tubes.

Since the DOT layouts are strictly 2-dimensional we are free to use the
third dimension to capture additional information.  For example
Section \ref{sec:fmflow} describes an application where the 3rd
dimension (the {\em z}-axis) is used to capture changes in the graph over time.
That is, the nodes are rendered as tubes and the edges may appear at different
levels in the {\em z} dimension.

\subsection{User Interfaces}
\subsection{Programming Interfaces}
\label{API}

A key design goal for Wilma was the provision of graph visualisation
facilities for other programs with very low barriers to development.  In order
to achieve this, we have implemented two external access APIs which give
programmers the ability to call up, extend and manipulate graph visualisations
in real-time.  These are the WilmaChat graph definition language, and the
Wilma CORBA interface.

\subsubsection{WilmaChat: A Dialogue on Graph Structure}

The simplest and lowest-energy programming interface to Wilma is the WilmaChat
language.  WilmaChat operates by invoking a server daemon which listens on a
socket or pipe on the machine in question.

Clients can connect to WilmaChat and control graphs by passing commands
in a simple language which allows them to instantiate arbitrary graph
structures.

The advantage of WilmaChat is that it requires extremely little infrastructure
from the developer's programming environment.  The ability to traverse
internal graph structures and print a simple, formalised description of them
is enough to produce navigable 3D output.

\subsubsection{The Wilma CORBA Interface}

While the WilmaChat language is extremely efficient for rapid application
development, and can be driven by any programming environment on Wilma's
supported platforms, there are a number of advanced features for which the
socket dialogue is an inefficient mode of interaction.  For example, if
developers want multiple clients to connect to a particular Wilma server, in
the presence of access-control mediation; or if they wish to perform detailed
interrogation of the graph embedding which Wilma has created --- then the use
of a custom language requires more overhead.

In order to meet these more sophisticated requirements, we have implemented a
Wilma control interface which sits atop CORBA (the Common Object Request
Broker Archicture --- see \url{http://www.corba.org}).  Since CORBA provides
its own access control mechanisms, and good CORBA bindings handle all the
marshaling and type requirements for a sophisticated API, programmers using
languages which support CORBA can take advantage of these facilities without
writing additional code.

\section{Results: The Importance of being Wilma}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Applications}
\subsubsection{3D UML Visualisation} \label{sec:3duml}
The first application of Wilma was an investigation into a 3D
extension of the Unified Modelling Language\cite{dwyer013D-UML}.
UML diagram elements were translated into 3D glyphs and a simple class
diagram editor was constructed on top of the Wilma framework.  A user study
was then conducted to test the feasibility of such a paradigm for
software design.  Interesting annecdotal evidence was collected
indicating that such 3D UML models, when coupled with a force directed
layout engine could help a software architect to understand structure
within a reasonably complex system.  An example of such a diagram is
shown in Figure \ref{fig-wilmaclasses3D}.

\subsubsection{Fund Manager Flow Visualisation} \label{sec:fmflow}
Most stock market visualisations involve a fairly straightforward
mapping of share attributes into 2 or 3 dimensional space.  The most
obvious example is share price time series charts.  In an experiment
into graph based visualisation techniques for stock market data
Dwyer~\cite{dwyer02fmflow} defined a graph model for Fund Manager
movement within the stock market.  The graph consists of nodes
representing stocks and edges representing a {\em movement} of a
fund manager between a pair of stocks.  A movement from one stock to
another occurs when a fund manager reduces his holding in the first
and increases his holding in the second.

The clients were particularly interested in seeing the changing
behaviour of fund managers over time.  This turned out to be a problem
of visualising a changing graph.  We showed these changes by
arranging the graph for each time period on a plane and then stacking
the time periods in the third dimension.  Nodes representing stocks
are extruded into columns whose width may be varied to indicate a
stock attribute such as unit price.  We call these 3D stacked graph
visualisations {\em stratified graphs}, borrowing the geological term.

Various styles of layout were tried in arranging these stratified
graphs in space.  Force
directed layout was useful for showing clustering and centrality of
highly active stocks while sugiyama style layout is useful for showing
flow from source stocks to sinks.  Figure \ref{fig-fm} shows an
example using the DOT layout engine in Wilma to produce 3D sugiyama
style layout.  A current research project is to tailor the hueristics
used in these layout algorithms to suit such stratified graphs.

  \caption{A visualisation of fund manager movement within the UK
  Computer Services sector for 5 time periods over 2 weeks in December.}
  \label{fig-fm}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Web Structure Visualisation}

One early application of Wilma was to the representation of web structure, and
to visualising clustering algorithms for categorising such
structure\cite{eckersley2kclassiscope}.

An example of web structure visualisation is shown in Figure~\ref{fig-web}.
This is a dataset collected in 2000 from the website \url{www.linuxlinks.com}.
The clusters are defined over similarity between pages; also note the set of
17 pages (linked to every other page) which form site's navigation bar.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We hope that the reader will by now be convinced that WilmaScope presents an
invaluable addition to the graph connoisseur's toolbox.  

Wilma provides its users with animated, interactive 3D rendering, which takes
advantage of modern accelerated graphics hardware.  These facilities are, of
course, available by other means --- but Wilma's API and user interface
endeavours to provide them at a minimum of user labour and/or coding.

It has a general purpose, extensible architecture, enabling creative
experimentation, domain-dependent extensions, and successive layers of
functionality-transparency for users.

Finally, WilmaScope is released under a free software license --- the Lesser
GNU General Public License, or LGPL
(\url{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html}), which maximises benefits for
the user community, guarantees an open development ecology and thus encourage
creative hacking all round.
