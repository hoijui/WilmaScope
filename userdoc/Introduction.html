<h2>Introduction</h2>
  WilmaScope or Wilma is a three dimensional interactive graph visualisation 
 and viewing system. &nbsp;It simulates physical forces to layout the graph,
for example edges are springy and nodes repel each other.&nbsp; You can use
Wilma to map out relationships between concepts,  data, records, software
entities, network nodes and so on.<br>
   
<p>This set of documentation is intended as a brief manual and reference
for Users of the Wilma system.&nbsp;</p>
