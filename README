INSTALLING WILMA:

This is actually really easy, just in trying to be platform independant and not
making any assumptions about who you are this README's become quite verbose.

STEP 1
------

first install J2SE V1.3.1 or greater
  (but 1.4beta didn't work last time I tried (June 2001))
  
  get it from: http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3
  
  just the runtime environment will do
  
STEP 2
------

then install Java3D V1.2.1 or greater
  get it from: 
    http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/download.html (Win/Solaris)
    ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/java/java3d/1.2.1/i386/fcs (Linux)
    
  again the runtime environment will do

NOTE: Debian packages for both of the above are also available from 
  ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/java/debian/dists/woody/non-free/binary-i386

  Other blackdown mirrors may also have the JDK and Java3D but many didn't seem to be up to date.

STEP 3
------

unzip the WILMA_{DATE}.zip file somewhere convenient

STEP 4
------

set JAVA_HOME to the place where your jdk installation lives:

  Windows: Start Menu
             -->Settings
               -->Control Panel
                 -->System
                   -->Advanced
                     -->Environment Variables

           Possible values (check your own setup!)
             c:\jdk1.3.1 
                - if you installed the full J2SDK (JDK) V1.3.1
             c:\Program Files\JavaSoft\JRE\1.3.1
                - if you installed the run time environment
             
  Linux/Solaris:
    export JAVA_HOME=Where-ever you installed java
    
    possible values:
      /usr/local/jdk1.3.1
      /usr/lib/j2sdk1.3.1 (this is where Debian usually puts it)

STEP 5
------

In the same way that you set JAVA_HOME now set the WILMA_HOME environment variable to the full path of the "Wilma" directory extracted from the zip

STEP 6
------
run:

Wilma/bin/wilma (linux/solaris/cygwin)
Wilma/bin/wilma.bat (Windows)

ENJOY!
